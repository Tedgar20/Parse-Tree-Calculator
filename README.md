# Parse-Tree-Java

This is simply a java version of the c++ parse tree that I wrote. Except that after I converted it from c++ to java I edited the java version so that it would operate as a calculator

When the program runs you will be greated with how to use the calculator.
It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
To my knowledge you can make the operation as long as you want with a mixture of as many operators as you want.
